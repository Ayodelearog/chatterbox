This project is a mini social media app, similar to Facebook that aims to use most of what I've have learned in the course of my React course with Pedro Machado. This app uses Firebase for backend functionality, function based components, google authentication to sign users into the app (which I'm really excited about). This is a simple app that has just a few pages and users can do simple things like create a post, like and unlike a post, etc. I'm really excited about this project because it would help me become very familiar with React syntax and learn to create component based websites and apps. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
